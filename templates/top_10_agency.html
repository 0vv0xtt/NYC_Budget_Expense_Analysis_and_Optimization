    <h2>Top1. Department of Education</h2>
    <p>The New York City government allocates over $615.3 billion to the Department of Education (DOE) due to the size and complexity of the city's public education system, which serves over 1.1 million students in more than 1,800 schools every year. This substantial budget allows the city to prioritize educational quality and equity, ensuring that all students have access to a high standard of education. It supports efforts to hire and retain qualified teachers and staff, address special education needs, maintain school infrastructure, and implement innovative educational initiatives. The allocation also provides resources for community engagement and parental involvement, emphasizing the city's commitment to fostering a conducive learning environment and meeting the diverse educational needs of its student population.</p>

    <h2>Top2. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>In the New York City budget, the "Miscellaneous" category serves as a versatile allocation, encompassing a diverse range of smaller agencies, programs, and services that do not fit within the purview of larger departments. With an allocation of over $281.7 billion dollars in recent years, this category enables the city to address emerging needs and support special projects and initiatives that may not have a dedicated agency or department yet. It also provides flexibility for funding grants to community organizations, non-profits, and other entities that contribute to public services. Moreover, the "Miscellaneous" category accommodates emergency and contingency funds, allowing the city to be prepared for unforeseen circumstances or urgent situations. As budgetary priorities may shift over time based on evolving circumstances and policy considerations, examining the specific expenses and initiatives within the "Miscellaneous" category in each fiscal year would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its vital role in the New York City government's financial planning and responsiveness to diverse community needs.</p>

    <h2>Top3. Department of Social Services</h2>
    <p>The allocation of approximately $235 billion USD to the Department of Social Services (DSS) by the NYC government from 2017 to 2024 can be attributed to various factors. Firstly, the DSS's responsibility for providing social welfare programs and services to support vulnerable populations, including the elderly, disabled, and financially disadvantaged, has likely led to increased demand for such services over the years. Additionally, economic conditions, demographic changes, and policy priorities have influenced budget decisions. Economic downturns and high unemployment rates may have prompted the government to allocate more funds to address growing social needs. Demographic shifts, such as an aging population, might have increased demand for healthcare, housing, and senior care services. Furthermore, the NYC government's commitment to addressing social inequality and improving residents' well-being has likely influenced higher budget allocations. Federal and state mandates, cost of living challenges, and the DSS's role in emergency response and crisis management may have also contributed to temporary budget increases. Overall, the allocation reflects the city's efforts to support its citizens' social welfare needs and ensure the provision of essential services for those in need.</p>

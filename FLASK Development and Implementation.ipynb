    "## Project Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The NYC Budget Expense Analysis and Optimization project was undertaken to address the challenges associated with managing the city's extensive and complex financial operations. The project aimed to leverage advanced data analytics to uncover opportunities for cost savings and efficiency improvements within New York City's government agencies. The analysis focused on comparing adopted and financial plan expense data to assess budget execution efficiency, identify areas of overspending, and propose rational budget adjustments. Utilizing a publicly available dataset from NYC Open Data, which is updated regularly, the project provided valuable insights for city planners, policymakers, and civic tech organizations to optimize resource allocation and enhance budget management strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technology Adoption\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of PostgreSQL and MongoDB for this project was driven by their complementary strengths. PostgreSQL, a robust SQL database, was selected for its ability to handle structured data with high accuracy and efficiency, ensuring reliable data integrity and performance. It was ideal for managing and querying the normalized tables that formed the backbone of the expense analysis. On the other hand, MongoDB, a NoSQL database, was chosen for its flexibility in handling unstructured and semi-structured data. Its scalability and ability to efficiently store and process large volumes of diverse data made it a perfect fit for the project's needs, especially in managing the varied datasets involved in the budget analysis. Together, these technologies provided a balanced and scalable solution, enabling the project to deliver detailed and accurate insights into NYC's budget expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data run by the NYC government can be found: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Expense-Budget/mwzb-yiwb/about_data\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disclaimer*: This is a student project. Some of the code in the visualization are courtesy of my teammate Leyi Shi. The MangoDB and Postgre have been set up by Jianfei Shi in the preliminary set up stage. ETL pipeline and data cleaning was primarily done by Yumeng Tian. This Project was conducted in August 2023, and the data were up to Aug 2023."

    "### Visualizations\n",
    "In our Flask web application, we integrated five key visualizations to enhance the analysis and user experience, providing users with an intuitive way to explore NYC budget expense data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Top 10 Agencies by Budget (by Fiscal Year)**: This visualization retrieves data from MongoDB to display the top 10 agencies with the highest budgets for a selected fiscal year. Using Plotly, we generate an interactive bar chart that highlights the distribution of budget allocations among these leading agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Agency Budget Trend (by Fiscal Year)**: This visualization allows users to track the adopted budget trends for a specific agency across multiple fiscal years. The bar chart, generated by Plotly, provides insights into how an agency's budget has evolved over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Top 10 Agencies by Total Budget Expense**: This bar chart ranks the top 10 agencies by their aggregated budget expenses. By querying MongoDB, we extract and visualize the data to offer a clear view of which agencies dominate in terms of overall budget expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Highest Expense-to-Planning Ratio**: This visualization identifies the top 10 agencies with the highest ratios of actual budget expenses to financial planning amounts. The bar chart generated by Plotly allows users to quickly assess which agencies are exceeding their planned budgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Lowest Expense-to-Planning Ratio**: Conversely, this bar chart highlights the top 10 agencies with the lowest expense-to-planning ratios. This visualization is crucial for identifying agencies that are spending well below their planned budgets, indicating potential underutilization of allocated resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive nature of Plotly's charts allows users to dynamically explore the data, adjust filters, and gain actionable insights with ease. This combination of advanced data visualization and user-centric design makes the application a powerful tool for budget analysis and decision-making."

    "### Flask Web Application Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This Flask web application is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for analyzing and visualizing NYC government budget expenses. The app allows users to retrieve and filter records, as well as generate interactive visualizations for in-depth analysis. Below are the pages that are in the application:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SQL Schema Explanation**: The `/schema` route renders a page that explains the SQL schema used in the project, offering users insights into the database design and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Record Retrieval**: The `/record-retrieving` route allows users to filter and retrieve budget expense records based on various criteria such as fiscal year, agency, and budget code. The filtered data is displayed in a user-friendly format, and the filter options are dynamically populated based on available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plot Analysis**: The `/plot-analysis` route provides access to a range of visualizations that help users analyze budget trends and agency performance. Users can select a fiscal year or agency to generate specific visualizations, such as the top 10 agencies by budget, an agency's budget trend over time, and comparisons of expense-to-planning ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Flask app serves as a powerful tool for budget analysis, helping stakeholders make informed decisions based on comprehensive data insights.\n"
